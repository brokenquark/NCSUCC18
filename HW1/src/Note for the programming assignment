ote for the Programming Assignment:
The identifier checking function in the regular expression class has been implemented. Still, there were some other problems in the given program
    1. It could not process meta statement such as comments starting with //. 
       The program was not taking newline character. Hence, the meta statement checking for comments was always returning false for comments. It has been fixed. 
    2. It could not show error message given the wrong symbol such as @. 
       If there were still some characters left with no identifiable tokens and it reaches the EOF â€“ that means there are some invalid inputs there. It has been fixed applying this logic.
