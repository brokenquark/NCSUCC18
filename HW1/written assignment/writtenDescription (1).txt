"Engineering A Compiler" textbook (2nd Edition):
Page 80: 1 (b, c); 2 (b, c); 4 (c); 5 (e); 7. only the third regular
expression (a,b,c).
Note: The knowledge for solving Problem 7 will be taught in our next
lecture.
If you don't have access to the textbook, you may see the scanned copy
in this attachment.

Submission instruction: a single PDF file, put into a compressed package with the scanner code. Your answer can be a scanned handwritten copy or electronically typed copy. Illegible answers will be ignored in grading.
No late submissions will be accepted.

Hints:
1. Regular expressions should be expressed in strings with only the
three basic operators (concatenation, alternation, kleene closure)
used; you may use some names as short representations of some constant
symbols (e.g., Dig -> 0, 1, 2, ..., 9); recursive definitions (e.g.,
X->X a) are not allowed.

2. For problems that ask you to write the regular expressions for a
language, if you believe that no regular expressions can represent the
language, just state that and then provide the reasons.

3. An important amendment to problem 5(e) in HW1: An
expression in the language to express must have balanced usage of
parentheses if it uses parentheses.

4. For problem 4c: a value less than a dollar should have "0" before
the decimal point (e.g., "$0.99" rather than "$.99").

5. Problem 2: FA should be DFA.

6. As our example DFA shows, any transition not appearing in an DFA is
considered illegal; you don't have to explicitly express 'Dead' or
'Error' states.
