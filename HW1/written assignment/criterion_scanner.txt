The coding part weights 40% of this howework grades. You should
specify the changed parts (give specific line numbers) of the code
that shows your own implementation (5%). The rest 35% is on the
correctness of your implementation. Your scanner should be able to be
compiled and run successfully by following your Readme on the VCL
Linux systems.  If your scanner fails in doing so, your project won't
be graded further and you will lose all the points. One exception
is that you have DETAILED documents on your implementation, the bugs
in your code and how you plan to fix them if you had more time.

We will use the test programs that we provide to you for grading.
